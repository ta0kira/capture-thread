// This example demonstrates how to work around a third-party framework that
// doesn't expose thread logic to the users of the framework. For example, an
// HTTP server framework might allow the user to implement a handler that it
// will call from an aribtrary thread. This should only be done in situations
// where the example in threaded.cc won't work.
