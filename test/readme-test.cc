// Code used in the quick-start in README.md. Make sure the two stay in sync!

// STEP 1

#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include "thread-capture.h"

// This class provides the instrumentation logic, both at the point the
// instrumentation is used (e.g., logging points) and where it is enabled (e.g.,
// log-capture points.) Note that instances of ThreadCapture cannot be moved,
// copied, or dynamically allocated.
class Logger : capture_thread::ThreadCapture<Logger> {
 public:
  Logger() : cross_and_capture_to_(this) {}

  // The static API is used at the instrumentation points. It will often be a
  // no-op if no instrumentation is in scope.
  static void Log(const std::string& line) {
    // GetCurrent() provides the instrumentation currently in scope, and is
    // always thread-safe and repeatable. The implementation of the
    // instrumentation must be explicitly made thread-safe, however.
    if (GetCurrent()) {
      GetCurrent()->LogLine(line);
    } else {
      std::cerr << "Not captured: \"" << line << "\"" << std::endl;
    }
  }

  // The non-static public API allows the creator of the instrumentation object
  // to access its contents. This is only necessary when the instrumentation is
  // gathering information, as opposed to propagating information.
  std::list<std::string> GetLines() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(lock_);
    return lines_;
  }

 private:
  // The private implementation applies to the instrumentation only when it's in
  // scope. This does not need to exactly mirror the static API, and in fact
  // only needs to differentiate between default and override behaviors.
  void LogLine(const std::string& line) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(lock_);
    lines_.emplace_back(line);
  }

  std::mutex lock_;
  std::list<std::string> lines_;
  // Add an AutoThreadCrosser to ensure that scoping is handled correctly. If
  // you absolutely don't want the instrumentation crossing threads, use
  // ScopedCapture instead. Always initialize with `this`.
  const AutoThreadCrosser cross_and_capture_to_;
};

// STEP 2

// #include the header for your instrumentation class.

// This function already exists in your code, and performs some sort of work for
// which you want to use the instrumentation.
void MyExistingFunction() {
  // Add calls to the static API where you need access to the instrumentation.
  Logger::Log("MyExistingFunction called");
}

// STEP 3

#include <thread>
#include "thread-crosser.h"

// (You don't need to #include the header for your instrumentation class here.)

// This function already exists in your code, and parallelizes some
// functionality that needs to use the instrumentation, but doesn't need to use
// the instrumentation itself.
void ParallelizeWork() {
  // Previously, the code just created a thread.
  // std::thread worker(&MyExistingFunction);

  // To pass along the instrumentation, wrap the thread with WrapCall. Also use
  // WrapCall when passing work to a worker thread, e.g., a thread pool.
  std::thread worker(
      capture_thread::ThreadCrosser::WrapCall(&MyExistingFunction));
  worker.join();
}

// STEP 4

// #include the header for your instrumentation class.

int main() {
  // If no instrumentation is in scope, the default behavior of the static API
  // is used where instrumentation calls are made. In this case, this will just
  // print the line to std::cerr.
  ParallelizeWork();

  // To make the instrumentation available within a given scope, just
  // instantiate your class. The framework will take care of the rest.
  Logger logger;

  // Since a Logger is in scope, the line will be captured to that instance,
  // rather than the default behavior of printing to std::cerr.
  ParallelizeWork();

  // In this case the instrumentation captures data, which is now available in
  // the local instance.
  for (const std::string& line : logger.GetLines()) {
    std::cerr << "The logger captured: \"" << line << "\"" << std::endl;
  }
}
